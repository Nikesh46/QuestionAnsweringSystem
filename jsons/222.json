different ways transport can occur.", "212": "Examples of elements that plants need to transport are nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, calcium, magnesium, and sulphur.", "213": "In vascular plants, these elements are extracted from the soil as soluble ions by the roots and transported throughout the plant in the xylem.", "214": "Most of the elements required for plant nutrition come from the chemical breakdown of soil minerals.", "215": "Sucrose produced by photosynthesis is transported from the leaves to other parts of the plant in the phloem and plant hormones are transported by a variety of processes.", "216": "The hypothesis that plant growth and development is coordinated by plant hormones or plant growth regulators first emerged in the late 19th century.", "217": "Darwin experimented on the movements of plant shoots and roots towards light and gravity, and concluded \"It is hardly an exaggeration to say that the tip of the radicle .", "218": ".", "219": "acts like the brain of one of the lower animals .", "220": ".", "221": "directing the several movements\".", "222": "About the same time, the role of auxins (from the Greek auxein, to grow) in control of plant growth was first outlined by the Dutch scientist Frits Went.", "223": "The first known auxin, indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), which promotes cell growth, was only isolated from plants about 50 years later.", "224": "This compound mediates the tropic responses of shoots and roots towards light and gravity.", "225": "The finding in 1939 that plant callus could be maintained in culture containing IAA, followed by the observation in 1947 that it could be induced to form roots and shoots by controlling the concentration of growth hormones were key steps in the development of plant biotechnology and genetic modification.", "226": "Cytokinins are a class of plant hormones named for their control of cell division or cytokinesis.", "227": "The natural cytokinin zeatin was discovered in corn, Zea mays, and is a derivative of the purine adenine.", "228": "Zeatin is produced in roots and transported to shoots in the xylem where it promotes cell division, bud development, and the greening of chloroplasts.", "229": "The gibberelins, such as Gibberelic acid are diterpenes synthesised from acetyl CoA via the mevalonate pathway.", "230": "They are involved in the promotion of germination and dormancy-breaking in seeds, in regulation of plant height by controlling stem elongation and the control of flowering.", "231": "Abscisic acid (ABA) occurs in all land plants except liverworts, and is synthesised from carotenoids in the chloroplasts and other plastids.", "232": "It inhibits cell division, promotes seed maturation, and dormancy, and promotes stomatal closure.", "233": "It was so named because it was originally thought to control abscission.", "234": "Ethylene is a gaseous hormone that is produced in all higher plant tissues from methionine.", "235": "It is now known to be the hormone that stimulates or regulates fruit ripening and abscission, and it, or the synthetic growth regulator ethephon which is rapidly metabolised to produce ethylene, are used on industrial scale to promote ripening of cotton, pineapples and other climacteric crops.", "236": "Plant anatomy is the study of the structure of plant cells and tissues, whereas plant morphology is the study of their external form.", "237": "All plants are multicellular eukaryotes, their DNA stored in nuclei.", "238": "The characteristic features of plant cells that distinguish them from those of animals and fungi include a primary cell wall composed of the polysaccharides cellulose, hemicellulose and pectin,  larger vacuoles than in animal cells and the presence of plastids with unique photosynthetic and biosynthetic functions as in the chloroplasts.", "239": "Other plastids contain storage products such as starch (amyloplasts) or lipids (elaioplasts).", "240": "Uniquely, streptophyte cells and those of the green algal order Trentepohliales divide by construction of a phragmoplast as a template for building a cell plate late in cell division.", "241": "The bodies of vascular plants including clubmosses, ferns and seed plants (gymnosperms and angiosperms) generally have aerial and subterranean subsystems.", "242": "The shoots consist of stems bearing green photosynthesising leaves and reproductive structures.", "243": "The underground vascularised roots bear root hairs at their tips and generally lack chlorophyll.", "244": "Non-vascular plants, the liverworts, hornworts and mosses do not produce ground-penetrating vascular roots and most of the plant participates in photosynthesis.", "245": "The sporophyte generation is nonphotosynthetic in liverworts but may be able to contribute part of its energy needs by photosynthesis in mosses and hornworts.", "246": "The root system and the shoot system are interdependent \u2013 the usually nonphotosynthetic root system depends on the shoot system for food, and the usually photosynthetic shoot system depends on water and minerals from the root system.", "247": "Cells in each system are capable of creating cells of the other and producing adventitious shoots or roots.", "248": "Stolons and tubers are examples of shoots that can grow roots.", "249": "Roots that spread out close to the surface, such as those of willows, can produce shoots and ultimately new plants.", "250": "In the event that one of the systems is lost, the other can often regrow it.", "251": "In fact it is possible to grow an entire plant from a single leaf, as is the case with Saintpaulia, or even a single cell \u2013 which can dedifferentiate into a callus (a mass of unspecialised cells) that can grow into a new plant.", "252": "In vascular plants, the xylem and phloem are the conductive tissues that transport resources between shoots and roots.", "253": "Roots are often adapted to store food such as sugars or starch, as in sugar beets and carrots.", "254": "Stems mainly provide support to the leaves and reproductive structures, but can store water in succulent plants such as cacti, food as in potato tubers, or reproduce

(secondary phloem and cork).", "260": "All gymnosperms and many angiosperms are woody plants.", "261": "Some plants reproduce sexually, some asexually, and some via both means.", "262": "Systematic botany is part of systematic biology, which is concerned with the range and diversity of organisms and their relationships, particularly as determined by their evolutionary history.", "263": "It involves, or is related to, biological classification, scientific taxonomy and phylogenetics.", "264": "Biological classification is the method by which botanists group organisms into categories such as genera or species.", "265": "Biological classification is a form of scientific taxonomy.", "266": "Modern taxonomy is rooted in the work of Carl Linnaeus, who grouped species according to shared physical characteristics.", "267": "These groupings have since been revised to align better with the Darwinian principle of common descent \u2013 grouping organisms by ancestry rather than superficial characteristics.", "268": "While scientists do not always agree on how to classify organisms, molecular phylogenetics, which uses DNA sequences as data, has driven many recent revisions along evolutionary lines and is likely to continue to do so.", "269": "The dominant classification system is called Linnaean taxonomy.", "270": "It includes ranks and binomial nomenclature.", "271": "The nomenclature of botanical organisms is codified in the International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants (ICN) and administered by the International Botanical Congress.", "272": "Kingdom Plantae belongs to Domain Eukarya and is broken down recursively until each species is separately classified.", "273": "The order is: Kingdom; Phylum (or Division); Class; Order; Family; Genus (plural genera); Species.", "274": "The scientific name of a plant represents its genus and its species within the genus, resulting in a single world-wide name for each organism.", "275": "For example, the tiger lily is Lilium columbianum.", "276": "Lilium is the genus, and columbianum the specific epithet.", "277": "The combination is the name of the species.", "278": "When writing the scientific name of an organism, it is proper to capitalise the first letter in the genus and put all of the specific epithet in lowercase.", "279": "Additionally, the entire term is ordinarily italicised (or underlined when italics are not available).", "280": "The evolutionary relationships and heredity of a group of organisms is called its phylogeny.", "281": "Phylogenetic studies attempt to discover phylogenies.", "282": "The basic approach is to use similarities based on shared inheritance to determine relationships.", "283": "As an example, species of Pereskia are trees or bushes with prominent leaves.", "284": "They do not obviously resemble a typical leafless cactus such as an Echinocactus.", "285": "However, both Pereskia and Echinocactus have spines produced from areoles (highly specialised pad-like structures) suggesting that the two genera are indeed related.", "286": "Judging relationships based on shared characters requires care, since plants may resemble one another through convergent evolution in which characters have arisen independently.", "287": "Some euphorbias have leafless, rounded bodies adapted to water conservation similar to those of globular cacti, but characters such as the structure of their flowers make it clear that the two groups are not closely related.", "288": "The cladistic method takes a systematic approach to characters, distinguishing between those that carry no information about shared evolutionary history \u2013 such as those evolved separately in different groups (homoplasies) or those left over from ancestors (plesiomorphies) \u2013 and derived characters, which have been passed down from innovations in a shared ancestor (apomorphies).", "289": "Only derived characters, such as the spine-producing areoles of cacti, provide evidence for descent from a common ancestor.", "290": "The results of cladistic analyses are expressed as cladograms: tree-like diagrams showing the pattern of evolutionary branching and descent.", "291": "From the 1990s onwards, the predominant approach to constructing phylogenies for living plants has been molecular phylogenetics, which uses molecular characters, particularly DNA sequences, rather than morphological characters like the presence or absence of spines and areoles.", "292": "The difference is that the genetic code itself is used to decide evolutionary relationships, instead of being used indirectly via the characters it gives rise to.", "293": "Clive Stace describes this as having \"direct access to the genetic basis of evolution.\"", "294": "As a simple example, prior to the use of genetic evidence, fungi were thought either to be plants or to be more closely related to plants than animals.", "295": "Genetic evidence suggests that the true evolutionary relationship of multicelled organisms is as shown in the cladogram below \u2013 fungi are more closely related to animals than to plants.", "296": "In 1998 the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group published a phylogeny for flowering plants based on an analysis of DNA sequences from most families of flowering plants.", "297": "As a result of this work, many questions, such as which families represent the earliest branches of angiosperms, have now been answered.", "298": "Investigating how plant species are related to each other allows botanists to better understand the process of evolution in plants.", "299": "Despite the study of model plants and increasing use of DNA evidence, there is ongoing work and discussion among taxonomists about how best to classify plants into various taxa.", "300": "Technological developments such as computers and electron microscopes have greatly increased the level of detail studied and speed at which data can be analysed."}
