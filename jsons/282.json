Johnson eventually improved the sound quality.", "32": "Abandoning Berliner's \"Gramophone\" trademark for legal reasons, in 1901 Johnson's and Berliner's separate companies reorganized to form the Victor Talking Machine Company, whose products would come to dominate the market for many years.", "33": "Emile Berliner moved his company to Montreal in 1900.", "34": "The factory which became RCA Victor stills exists.", "35": "There is a dedicated museum in Montreal for Berliner.", "36": "In 1901, 10-inch disc records were introduced, followed in 1903 by 12-inch records.", "37": "These could play for more than three and four minutes respectively, while contemporary cylinders could only play for about two minutes.", "38": "In an attempt to head off the disc advantage, Edison introduced the Amberol cylinder in 1909, with a maximum playing time of 4\u00bd minutes (at 160 rpm), which in turn were superseded by Blue Amberol Records, which had a playing surface made of celluloid, a plastic, which was far less fragile.", "39": "Despite these improvements, during the 1910s discs decisively won this early format war, although Edison continued to produce new Blue Amberol cylinders for an ever-dwindling customer base until late in 1929.", "40": "By 1919 the basic patents for the manufacture of lateral-cut disc records had expired, opening the field for countless companies to produce them.", "41": "Analog disc records would dominate the home entertainment market until they were outsold by the digital compact disc in the late 1980s (which was in turn supplanted by digital audio recordings distributed via online music stores and Internet file sharing).", "42": "Early recordings were made entirely acoustically, the sound being collected by a horn and piped to a diaphragm, which vibrated the cutting stylus.", "43": "Sensitivity and frequency range were poor, and frequency response was very irregular, giving acoustic recordings an instantly recognizable tonal quality.", "44": "A singer practically had to put his or her face in the recording horn.", "45": "Lower-pitched orchestral instruments such as cellos and double basses were often doubled (or replaced) by louder wind instruments, such as tubas.", "46": "Standard violins in orchestral ensembles were commonly replaced by Stroh violins, which became popular with recording studios.", "47": "Contrary to popular belief, if placed properly and prepared-for, drums could be effectively used and heard on even the earliest jazz and military band recordings.", "48": "The loudest instruments such as the drums and trumpets were positioned the farthest away from the collecting horn.", "49": "Lillian Hardin Armstrong, a member of King Oliver's Creole Jazz Band, which recorded at Gennett Records in 1923, remembered that at first Oliver and his young second trumpet, Louis Armstrong, stood next to each other and Oliver's horn could not be heard.", "50": "\"They put Louis about fifteen feet over in the corner, looking all sad.\"", "51": "For fading instrumental parts in and out while recording, some performers were placed on a moveable platform, which could draw the performer(s) nearer or further away as required.", "52": "[citation needed] During the first half of the 1920s, engineers at Western Electric, as well as independent inventors such as Orlando Marsh, developed technology for capturing sound with a microphone, amplifying it with vacuum tubes, then using the amplified signal to drive an electromagnetic recording head.", "53": "Western Electric's innovations resulted in a greatly expanded and more even frequency response, creating a dramatically fuller, clearer and more natural-sounding recording.", "54": "Distant or less strong sounds that were impossible to record by the old methods could now be captured.", "55": "Volume was now limited only by the groove spacing on the record and the limitations of the intended playback device.", "56": "Victor and Columbia licensed the new electrical system from Western Electric and began issuing electrically recorded discs in 1925.", "57": "The first classical recording was of Chopin impromptus and Schubert's Litanei by Alfred Cortot for Victor.", "58": "Electrical recording preceded electrical home reproduction because of the initial high cost of the new system.", "59": "In 1925, the Victor company introduced the Victor Orthophonic Victrola, an acoustical record player that was specifically designed to play electrically recorded discs, as part of a line that also included electrically reproducing Electrolas.", "60": "The acoustical Orthophonics ranged in price from US$95 to US$300, depending on cabinetry; by comparison, the cheapest Electrola cost US$650, the price of a new Ford automobile in an era when clerical jobs paid about $20 a week.", "61": "The earliest disc records (1889\u20131894) were made of various materials including hard rubber.", "62": "Around 1895, a shellac-based compound was introduced and became standard.", "63": "Exact formulas for this compound varied by manufacturer and over the course of time, but it was typically composed of about one-third shellac and about two-thirds mineral filler, which meant finely pulverized rock, usually slate and limestone, with an admixture of cotton fibers to add tensile strength, carbon black for color (without this, it tended to be a \"dirty\" gray or brown color that most record companies considered unattractive), and a very small amount of a lubricant to facilitate mold release during manufacture.", "64": "Some makers, notably Columbia Records, used a laminated construction with a core disc of coarser material or fiber.", "65": "The production of shellac records continued until the end of the 78 rpm format (i.e., the late 1950s in most developed countries, but well into the 1960s in some other places), but increasingly less abrasive formulations were used during its declining years and very late examples in truly like-new condition can have as low noise levels as vinyl.", "66": "Flexible or so-called \"unbreakable\" records made of unusual materials were introduced by a number of manufacturers at various times during the 78 rpm era.", "67": "In the UK, Nicole records, made of celluloid or a similar substance coated onto a cardboard core disc, were produced for a few years beginning in 1904, but they suffered from an exceptionally high level of surface noise.", "68": "In the United States, Columbia Records introduced flexible, fiber-cored \"Marconi Velvet Tone Record\" pressings in 1907, but the advantages and longevity of their relatively noiseless surfaces depended on the scrupulous use of special gold-plated Marconi Needles and the product was not a success.", "69": "Thin, flexible plastic records such as the German Phonycord and the British Filmophone and Goodson records appeared around 1930 but also did not last long.", "70": "The contemporary French Path\u00e9 Cellodiscs, made of a very thin black plastic, which uncannily resembles the vinyl \"sound sheet\" magazine inserts of the 1965\u20131985 era, were similarly short-lived.", "71": "In the US, Hit of the Week records, made of a patented translucent plastic called Durium coated on a heavy brown paper base, were introduced in early 1930.", "72": "A new issue came out every week and they were sold at newsstands like a weekly magazine.", "73": "Although inexpensive and commercially successful at first, they soon fell victim to the Great Depression and production in the US ended in 1932.", "74": "Related Durium records continued to be made somewhat later in the UK and elsewhere, and as remarkably late as 1950 in Italy, where the name \"Durium\" survived far into the LP era as a trademark on ordinary vinyl records.", "75": "Despite all these attempts at innovation, shellac compounds continued to be used for the overwhelming majority of commercial 78 rpm records during the lifetime of the format.", "76": "In 1931, RCA Victor introduced their vinyl-based Victrolac compound as a material for some unusual-format and special-purpose records.", "77": "By the end of the 1930s vinyl's advantages of light weight, relative unbreakability and low surface noise had made it the material of choice for prerecorded radio programming and other critical applications.", "78": "When it came to ordinary 78 rpm records, however, the much higher cost of the raw material, as well as its vulnerability to the heavy pickups and crudely mass-produced steel needles still commonly used in home record players, made its general substitution for shellac impractical at that time.", "79": "During the Second World War, the United States Armed Forces produced thousands of 12-inch vinyl 78 rpm V-Discs for use by the troops overseas.", "80": "After the war, the wider use of vinyl became more practical as new record players with relatively lightweight crystal pickups and precision-ground styli made of sapphire or an exotic osmium alloy proliferated.", "81": "In late 1945, RCA Victor began offering special transparent red vinyl De Luxe pressings of some classical 78s, at a de luxe price.", "82": "Later, Decca Records introduced vinyl Deccalite 78s, while other record companies came up with vinyl concoctions such as Metrolite, Merco Plastic and Sav-o-flex, but these were mainly used to produce \"unbreakable\" children's records and special thin vinyl DJ pressings for shipment to radio stations.", "83": "In the 1890s, the recording formats of the earliest (toy) discs were mainly 12.5 cm (nominally five inches) in diameter; by the mid-1890s, the discs were usually 7 in (nominally 17.5 cm) in diameter.", "84": "By 1910 the 10-inch (25.4 cm) record was by far the most popular standard, holding about three minutes of music or other entertainment on a side.", "85": "From 1903 onwards, 12-inch records (30.5 cm) were also sold commercially, mostly of classical music or operatic selections, with four to five minutes of music per side.", "86": "Victor, Brunswick and Columbia also issued 12-inch popular medleys, usually spotlighting a Broadway show score.", "87": "However, other sizes did appear.", "88": "Eight-inch discs with a 2-inch-diameter (51 mm) label became popular for about a decade in Britain, but they cannot be played in full on most modern record players because the tone arm cannot play far enough in toward the center without modification of the equipment.", "89": "The playing time of a phonograph record depended on the turntable speed and the groove spacing.", "90": "At the beginning of the 20th century, the early discs played for two minutes, the same as early cylinder records.", "91": "The 12-inch disc, introduced by Victor in 1903, increased the playing time to three and a half minutes.", "92": "Because a 10-inch 78 rpm record could hold about three minutes of sound per side and the 10-inch size was the standard size for popular music, almost all popular recordings were limited to around three minutes in length.", "93": "For example, when King Oliver's Creole Jazz Band, including Louis Armstrong on his first recordings, recorded 13 sides at Gennett Records in Richmond, Indiana, in 1923, one side was 2:09 and four sides were 2:52\u20132:59.", "94": "In January 1938, Milt Gabler started recording for his new label, Commodore Records, and to allow for longer continuous performances, he recorded some 12-inch records.", "95": "Eddie Condon explained: \"Gabler realized that a jam session needs room for development.\"", "96": "The first two 12-inch recordings did not take advantage of the extra length: \"Carnegie Drag\" was 3:15; \"Carnegie Jump\", 2:41.", "97": "But at the second session, on April 30, the two 12-inch recordings were longer: \"Embraceable You\" was 4:05; \"Serenade to a Shylock\", 4:32.", "98": "Another way around the time limitation was to issue a selection on both sides of a single record.", "99": "Vaudeville stars Gallagher and Shean recorded \"Mr. Gallagher and Mr. Shean\", written by Irving and Jack Kaufman, as two sides of a 10-inch 78 in 1922 for Cameo.", "100": "An obvious workaround for longer recordings was to release a set of records.", "101": "An early multi-record release was in 1903, when HMV in England made the first complete recording of an opera, Verdi's Ernani, on 40 single-sided discs.", "102": "In 1940, Commodore released Eddie Condon and his Band's recording of \"A Good Man Is Hard to Find\" in four parts, issued on both sides of two 12-inch 78s.", "103": "This limitation on the duration of recordings persisted from 1910 until the invention of the LP record, in 1948.", "104": "In popular music, this time limitation of about 3:30 on a 10-inch 78 rpm record meant that singers usually did not release long pieces on record.", "105": "One exception is Frank Sinatra's recording of Rodgers and Hammerstein's \"Soliloquy\", from Carousel, made on May 28, 1946.", "106": "Because it ran 7:57, longer than both sides of a standard 78 rpm 10-inch record, it was released on Columbia's Masterwork label (the classical division) as two sides of a 12-inch record.", "107": "The same was true of John Raitt's performance of the song on the original cast album of Carousel, which had been issued on a 78-rpm album set by American Decca in 1945.", "108": "German record company Odeon is often said to have pioneered the album in 1909 when it released the Nutcracker Suite by Tchaikovsky on 4 double-sided discs in a specially designed package.", "109": "(It is not indicated what size the records are.)", "110": "However, Deutsche Grammophon had produced an album for its complete recording of the opera Carmen in the previous year.", "111": "The practice of issuing albums does not seem to have been widely taken up by other record companies for many years; however, HMV provided an album, with a pictorial cover, for the 1917 recording of The Mikado (Gilbert & Sullivan).", "112": "By about 1910,[note 1] bound collections of empty sleeves with a paperboard or leather cover, similar to a photograph album, were sold as record albums that customers could use to store their records (the term \"record album\" was printed on some covers).", "113": "These albums came in both 10-inch and 12-inch sizes.", "114": "The covers of these bound books were wider and taller than the records inside, allowing the record album to be placed on a shelf upright, like a book, suspending the fragile records above the shelf and protecting them.", "115": "In the 1930s, record companies began issuing collections of 78 rpm records by one performer or of one type of music in specially assembled albums, typically with artwork on the front cover and liner notes on the back or inside cover.", "116": "Most albums included three or four records, with two sides each, making six or eight tunes per album.", "117": "When the 12-inch vinyl LP era began in 1949, the single record often had the same or similar number of tunes as a typical album of 78s, and was still often referred to as an \"album\".", "118": "For collectable or nostalgia purposes, or for the benefit of higher-quality audio playback provided by the 78 rpm speed with newer vinyl records and their lightweight stylus pickups, a small number of 78 rpm records have been released since the major labels ceased production.", "119": "One of the first attempts at this was in the 1950s, when inventor Ewing Dunbar Nunn founded the label Audiophile Records, which released, in addition to standard 33 1/3 rpm LPs, 78 rpm-mastered albums that were microgroove and pressed on vinyl (as opposed to traditional 78s, with their shellac composition and wider 3-mil sized grooves).", "120": "This was done by the label mainly to take advantage of the wider audio frequency response that faster speeds like 78 rpm can provide for vinyl microgroove records, hence the label's name (obviously catering to the audiophiles of the 1950s \"hi-fi\" era, when stereo gear could provide a much wider range of audio than before).", "121": "Also in the late 1950s, Bell Records released a few budget-priced 7\" microgrooved records at 78 rpm.", "122": "In 1968, Reprise planned to release a series of 78 rpm singles from their artists on their label at the time, called the Reprise Speed Series.", "123": "Only one disc actually saw release, Randy Newman's I Think It's Going to Rain Today, a track from his self-titled debut album (with The Beehive State on the flipside).", "124": "Reprise did not proceed further with the series due to a lack of sales for the single, and a lack of general interest in the concept.", "125": "Guitarist & vocalist Leon Redbone released a promotional 78 rpm record in 1978 featuring two songs (Alabama Jubilee and Please Don't Talk About Me When I'm Gone) from his Champagne Charlie album.", "126": "In 1980 Stiff Records in the United Kingdom issued a 78 by Joe \"King\" Carrasco containing the songs Buena (Spanish for \"good,\" with the alternate spelling \"Bueno\" on the label) and Tuff Enuff.", "127": "Underground comic cartoonist and 78 rpm record collector Robert Crumb released three discs with his Cheap Suit Serenaders in the 1980s.", "128": "In the 1990s Rhino Records issued a series of boxed sets of 78 rpm reissues of early rock and roll hits, intended for owners of vintage jukeboxes.", "129": "This was a disaster because Rhino did not warn customers that their records were made of vinyl, and that the vintage 78 RPM juke boxes were designed with heavy tone arms and steel needles to play the hard shellac records of their time.", "130": "This failure to warn customers gave the Rhino 78 records a bad reputation,[citation needed] as they were destroyed by old juke boxes and old record players but played very well on newer 78-capable turntables with modern lightweight tone arms and jewel needles.", "131": "In 1931, RCA Victor launched the first commercially available vinyl long-playing record, marketed as program-transcription discs.", "132": "These revolutionary discs were designed for playback at 33 1\u20443 rpm and pressed on a 30 cm diameter flexible plastic disc, with a duration of about ten minutes playing time per side.", "133": "RCA Victor's early introduction of a long-play disc was a commercial failure for several reasons including the lack of affordable, reliable consumer playback equipment and consumer wariness during the Great Depression.", "134": "Because of financial hardships that plagued the recording industry during that period (and RCA's own parched revenues), Victor's long-playing records were discontinued by early 1933.", "135": "Vinyl's lower surface noise level than shellac was not forgotten, nor was its durability.", "136": "In the late 1930s, radio commercials and pre-recorded radio programs being sent to disc jockeys started being stamped in vinyl, so they would not break in the mail.", "137": "In the mid-1940s, special DJ copies of records started being made of vinyl also, for the same reason.", "138": "These were all 78 rpm.", "139": "During and after World War II, when shellac supplies were extremely limited, some 78 rpm records were pressed in vinyl instead of shellac, particularly the six-minute 12-inch (30 cm) 78 rpm records produced by V-Disc for distribution to United States troops in World War II.", "140": "In the 1940s, radio transcriptions, which were usually on 16-inch records, but sometimes 12-inch, were always made of vinyl, but cut at 33 1\u20443 rpm.", "141": "Shorter transcriptions were often cut at 78 rpm.", "142": "Beginning in 1939, Dr. Peter Goldmark and his staff at Columbia Records and at CBS Laboratories undertook efforts to address problems of recording and playing back narrow grooves and developing an inexpensive, reliable consumer playback system.", "143": "It took about eight years of study, except when it was suspended because of World War II.", "144": "Finally, the 12-inch (30 cm) Long Play (LP) 33 1\u20443 rpm microgroove record album was introduced by the Columbia Record Company at a New York press conference on June 18, 1948.", "145": "Unwilling to accept and license Columbia's system, in February 1949 RCA Victor, in cooperation of its parent, the Radio Corporation of America, released the first 45 rpm single, 7 inches in diameter with a large center hole.", "146": "The 45 rpm player included a changing mechanism that allowed multiple disks to be stacked, much as a conventional changer handled 78s.", "147": "The short playing time of a single 45 rpm side meant that long works, such as symphonies, had to be released on multiple 45s instead of a single LP, but RCA claimed that the new high-speed changer rendered side breaks so brief as to be inaudible or inconsequential.", "148": "Early 45 rpm records were made from either vinyl or polystyrene.", "149": "They had a playing time of eight minutes.", "150": "One early attempt at lengthening the playing time should be mentioned.", "151": "At least one manufacturer in the early 1920s, World Records, produced records that played at a constant linear velocity, controlled by Noel Pemberton Billing's patented add-on governor device.", "152": "As these were played from the outside to the inside, the rotational speed of the records increased as reproduction progressed.", "153": "This action is similar (although in reverse) to that on the modern compact disc and the CLV version of its predecessor, the Philips Laser Disc.", "154": "In 1925, 78.26 rpm was chosen as the standard because of the introduction of the electrically powered synchronous turntable motor.", "155": "This motor ran at 3600 rpm, such that a 46:1 gear ratio would produce 78.26 rpm.", "156": "In parts of the world that used 50 Hz current, the standard was 77.92 rpm (3,000 rpm with a 77:2 ratio), which was also the speed at which a strobe disc with 77 lines would \"stand still\" in 50 Hz light (92 lines for 60 Hz).", "157": "After World War II these records were retroactively known as 78s, to distinguish them from other newer disc record formats.", "158": "Earlier they were just called records, or when there was a need to distinguish them from cylinders, disc records.", "159": "The older 78 format continued to be mass-produced alongside the newer formats using new materials until about 1960 in the U.S., and in a few countries, such as India (where some Beatles recordings were issued on 78), into the 1960s.", "160": "For example, Columbia Records' last reissue of Frank Sinatra songs on 78 rpm records was an album called Young at Heart, issued November 1, 1954.", "161": "As late as the 1970s, some children's records were released at the 78 rpm speed.", "162": "In the United Kingdom, the 78 rpm single lasted longer than in the United States and the 45 rpm took longer to become popular.", "163": "The 78 rpm was overtaken in popularity by the 45 rpm in the late 1950s, as teenagers became increasingly affluent.", "164": "Some of Elvis Presley's early singles on Sun Records might have sold more copies on 78 than on 45.", "165": "This is because the majority of those sales in 1954\u201355 were to the \"hillbilly\" market in the South and Southwestern United States, where replacing the family 78 rpm player with a new 45 rpm player was a luxury few could afford at the time.", "166": "By the end of 1957, RCA Victor announced that 78s accounted for less than 10% of Presley's singles sales, essentially announcing the death throes of the 78 rpm format.", "167": "The last Presley single released on 78 in the United States was RCA Victor 20-7410, I Got Stung/One Night (1958), while the last 78 in the UK was RCA 1194, A Mess Of Blues/Girl Of My Best Friend (1960).", "168": "After World War II, two new competing formats came onto the market and gradually replaced the standard \"78\": the 33 1\u20443 rpm (often just referred to as the 33 rpm), and the 45 rpm (see above).", "169": "The 33 1\u20443 rpm LP (for \"long-play\") format was developed by Columbia Records and marketed in June 1948.",

record companies agreed to a common recording standard called RIAA equalization.", "173": "Prior to the establishment of the standard each company used its own preferred standard, requiring discriminating listeners to use pre-amplifiers with multiple selectable equalization curves.", "174": "Some recordings, such as books for the blind, were pressed at 16 2\u20443 rpm.", "175": "Prestige Records released jazz records in this format in the late 1950s; for example, two of their Miles Davis albums were paired together in this format.", "176": "Peter Goldmark, the man who developed the 33 1\u20443 rpm record, developed the Highway Hi-Fi 16 2\u20443 rpm record to be played in Chrysler automobiles, but poor performance of the system and weak implementation by Chrysler and Columbia led to the demise of the 16 2\u20443 rpm records.", "177": "Subsequently, the 16 2\u20443 rpm speed was used for narrated publications for the blind and visually impaired, and were never widely commercially

lost, because it took a lot of sound energy to vibrate the recording horn diaphragm and cutting mechanism.", "380": "There were acoustic limitations due to mechanical resonances in both the recording and playback system.", "381": "Some pictures of acoustic recording sessions show horns wrapped with tape to help mute these resonances.", "382": "Even an acoustic recording played back electrically on modern equipment sounds like it was recorded through a horn, notwithstanding a reduction in distortion because of the modern playback.", "383": "Toward the end of the acoustic era, there were many fine examples of recordings made with horns.", "384": "Electric recording which developed during the time that early radio was becoming popular (1925) benefited from the microphones and amplifiers used in radio studios.", "385": "The early electric recordings were reminiscent tonally of acoustic recordings, except there was more recorded bass and treble as well as delicate sounds and overtones cut on the records.", "386": "This was in spite of some carbon microphones used, which had resonances that colored the recorded tone.", "387": "The double button carbon microphone with stretched diaphragm was a marked improvement.", "388": "Alternatively, the Wente style condenser microphone used with the Western Electric licensed recording method had a brilliant midrange and was prone to overloading from sibilants in speech, but generally it gave more accurate reproduction than carbon microphones.", "389": "It was not unusual for electric recordings to be played back on acoustic phonographs.", "390": "The Victor Orthophonic phonograph was a prime example where such playback was expected.", "391": "In the Orthophonic, which benefited from telephone research, the mechanical pickup head was redesigned with lower resonance than the traditional mica type.", "392": "Also, a folded horn with an exponential taper was constructed inside the cabinet to provide better impedance matching to the air.", "393": "As a result, playback of an Orthophonic record sounded like it was coming from a radio.", "394": "Eventually, when it was more common for electric recordings to be played back electrically in the 1930s and 1940s, the overall tone was much like listening to a radio of the era.", "395": "Magnetic pickups became more common and were better designed as time went on, making it possible to improve the damping of spurious resonances.", "396": "Crystal pickups were also introduced as lower cost alternatives.", "397": "The dynamic or moving coil microphone was introduced around 1930 and the velocity or ribbon microphone in 1932.", "398": "Both of these high quality microphones became widespread in motion picture, radio, recording, and public address applications.", "399": "Over time, fidelity, dynamic and noise levels improved to the point that it was harder to tell the difference between a live performance in the studio and the recorded version.", "400": "This was especially true after the invention of the variable reluctance magnetic pickup cartridge by General Electric in the 1940s when high quality cuts were played on well-designed audio systems.", "401": "The Capehart radio/phonographs of the era with large diameter electrodynamic loudspeakers, though not ideal, demonstrated this quite well with \"home recordings\" readily available in the music stores for the public to buy.", "402": "There were important quality advances in recordings specifically made for radio broadcast.", "403": "In the early 1930s Bell Telephone Laboratories and Western Electric announced the total reinvention of disc recording: the Western Electric Wide Range System, \"The New Voice of Action\".", "404": "The intent of the new Western Electric system was to improve the overall quality of disc recording and playback.", "405": "The recording speed was 33 1\u20443 rpm, originally used in the Western Electric/ERPI movie audio disc system implemented in the early Warner Brothers' Vitaphone \"talkies\" of 1927.", "406": "The newly invented Western Electric moving coil or dynamic microphone was part of the Wide Range System.", "407": "It had a flatter audio response than the old style Wente condenser type and didn't require electronics installed in the microphone housing.", "408": "Signals fed to the cutting head were pre-emphasized in the treble region to help override noise in playback.", "409": "Groove cuts in the vertical plane were employed rather than the usual lateral cuts.", "410": "The chief advantage claimed was more grooves per inch that could be crowded together, resulting in longer playback time.", "411": "Additionally, the problem of inner groove distortion, which plagued lateral cuts, could be avoided with the vertical cut system.", "412": "Wax masters were made by flowing heated wax over a hot metal disc thus avoiding the microscopic irregularities of cast blocks of wax and the necessity of planing and polishing.", "413": "Vinyl pressings were made with stampers from master cuts that were electroplated in vacuo by means of gold sputtering.", "414": "Audio response was claimed out to 8,000 Hz, later 13,000 Hz, using light weight pickups employing jeweled styli.", "415": "Amplifiers and cutters both using negative feedback were employed thereby improving the range of frequencies cut and lowering distortion levels.", "416": "Radio transcription producers such as World Broadcasting System and Associated Music Publishers (AMP) were the dominant licensees of the Western Electric wide range system and towards the end of the 1930s were responsible for two-thirds of the total radio transcription business.", "417": "These recordings use a bass turnover of 300 Hz and a 10,000 Hz rolloff of \u22128.5 dB.", "418": "The complete technical disclosure of the Columbia LP by Peter C. Goldmark, Rene' Snepvangers and William S. Bachman in 1949 made it possible for a great variety of record companies to get into the business of making long playing records.", "419": "The business grew quickly and interest spread in high fidelity sound and the do-it-yourself market for pickups, turntables, amplifier kits, loudspeaker enclosure plans, and AM/FM radio tuners.", "420": "The LP record for longer works, 45 rpm for pop music, and FM radio became high fidelity program sources in demand.", "421": "Radio listeners heard recordings broadcast and this in turn generated more record sales.", "422": "The industry flourished.", "423": "There is a theory that vinyl records can audibly represent higher frequencies than compact discs.", "424": "According to Red Book specifications, the compact disc has a frequency response of 20 Hz up to 22,050 Hz, and most CD players measure flat within a fraction of a decibel from at least 20 Hz to 20 kHz at full output.", "425": "Turntable rumble obscures the low-end limit of vinyl but the upper end can be, with some cartridges, reasonably flat within a few decibels to 30 kHz, with gentle roll-off.", "426": "Carrier signals of Quad LPs popular in the 1970s were at 30 kHz to be out of the range of human hearing.", "427": "The average human auditory system is sensitive to frequencies from 20 Hz to a maximum of around 20,000 Hz.", "428": "The upper and lower frequency limits of human hearing vary per person.", "429": "For the first several decades of disc record manufacturing, sound was recorded directly on to the \"master disc\" at the recording studio.", "430": "From about 1950 on (earlier for some large record companies, later for some small ones) it became usual to have the performance first recorded on audio tape, which could then be processed and/or edited, and then dubbed on to the master disc.", "431": "A record cutter would engrave the grooves into the master disc.", "432": "Early versions of these master discs were soft wax, and later a harder lacquer was used.", "433": "The mastering process was originally something of an art as the operator had to manually allow for the changes in sound which affected how wide the space for the groove needed to be on each rotation.", "434": "As the playing of gramophone records causes gradual degradation of the recording, they are best preserved by transferring them onto other media and playing the records as rarely as possible.", "435": "They need to be stored on edge, and do best under environmental conditions that most humans would find comfortable.", "436": "The medium needs to be kept clean, but alcohol should only be used on PVC or optical media, not on 78s.", "437": "[citation needed] The equipment for playback of certain formats (e.g., 16 and 78 rpm) is manufactured only in small quantities, leading to increased difficulty in finding equipment to play the recordings.", "438": "Where old disc recordings are considered to be of artistic or historic interest, from before the era of tape or where no tape master exists, archivists play back the disc on suitable equipment and record the result, typically onto a digital format, which can be copied and manipulated to remove analog flaws without any further damage to the source recording.", "439": "For example, Nimbus Records uses a specially built horn record player to transfer 78s.", "440": "Anyone can do this using a standard record player with a suitable pickup, a phono-preamp (pre-amplifier) and a typical personal computer.", "441": "However, for accurate transfer, professional archivists carefully choose the correct stylus shape and diameter, tracking weight, equalisation curve and other playback parameters and use high-quality analogue-to-digital converters.", "442": "Groove recordings, first designed in the final quarter of the 19th century, held a predominant position for nearly a century\u2014withstanding competition from reel-to-reel tape, the 8-track cartridge, and the compact cassette.", "443": "In 1988, the compact disc surpassed the gramophone record in unit sales.", "444": "Vinyl records experienced a sudden decline in popularity between 1988 and 1991, when the major label distributors restricted their return policies, which retailers had been relying on to maintain and swap out stocks of relatively unpopular titles.", "445": "First the distributors began charging retailers more for new product if they returned unsold vinyl, and then they stopped providing any credit at all for returns.", "446": "Retailers, fearing they would be stuck with anything they ordered, only ordered proven, popular titles that they knew would sell, and devoted more shelf space to CDs and cassettes.", "447": "Record companies also deleted many vinyl titles from production and distribution, further undermining the availability of the format and leading to the closure of pressing plants.", "448": "This rapid decline in the availability of records accelerated the format's decline in popularity, and is seen by some as a deliberate ploy to make consumers switch to CDs, which were more profitable for the record companies.", "449": "In spite of their flaws, such as the lack of portability, records still have enthusiastic supporters.", "450": "Vinyl records continue to be manufactured and sold today, especially by independent rock bands and labels, although record sales are considered to be a niche market composed of audiophiles, collectors, and DJs.", "451": "Old records and out-of-print recordings in particular are in much demand by collectors the world over.", "452": "(See Record collecting.)", "453": "Many popular new albums are given releases on vinyl records and older albums are also given reissues, sometimes on audiophile-grade vinyl.", "454": "Many electronic dance music and hip hop releases today are still preferred on vinyl; however, digital copies are still widely available.", "455": "This is because for disc jockeys (\"DJs\"), vinyl has an advantage over the CD: direct manipulation of the medium.", "456": "DJ techniques such as slip-cueing, beatmatching, and scratching originated on turntables.", "457": "With CDs or compact audio cassettes one normally has only indirect manipulation options, e.g., the play, stop, and pause buttons.", "458": "With a record one can place the stylus a few grooves farther in or out, accelerate or decelerate the turntable, or even reverse its direction, provided the stylus, record player, and record itself are built to withstand it.", "459": "However, many CDJ and DJ advances, such as DJ software and time-encoded vinyl, now have these capabilities and more.", "460": "In 2014 artist Jack White sold 40,000 copies of his second solo release, Lazaretto, on vinyl.", "461": "The sales of the record beat the largest sales in one week on vinyl since 1991.", "462": "The sales record was previously held by Pearl Jam's, Vitalogy, which sold 34,000 copies in one week in 1994.", "463": "In 2014, the sale of vinyl records was the only physical music medium with increasing sales with relation to the previous year.", "464": "Sales of other mediums including individual digital tracks, digital albums and compact discs have fallen, the latter having the greatest drop-in-sales rate."}
